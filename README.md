ðŸ”¥ The project is a landing page that I produce when I practice TailwindCSS. On the other hand, repo also has the challenges of front-end mentors.

ðŸŽ¯ Feature:
+ Responsive website
+ Simple verify email
+ Some animation CSS

Run repo:

1. When you download or clone repo, then -> Open project on VSCode -> Install Live Server extension.

2. Run yarn build:css first due to run CSS, next Run file index.html in (public/index.html) by Live Server.

ðŸš€ Link deploy: https://babykachima-fylo-landingpage.web.app/

Thanks for visit repo! ðŸ˜¸
